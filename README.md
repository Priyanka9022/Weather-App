Project: Weather App

The Weather App is a web-based application that provides real-time weather updates for any location. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes weather APIs to fetch live weather data. The app displays information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions using a clean and user-friendly interface.

Key Features:-
Search Functionality – Users can enter a city name to get weather details.
Live Weather Data – The app fetches real-time data from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
Temperature & Conditions – Displays current temperature, weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy), humidity, and wind speed.
Dynamic Background & Icons – Changes background or icons based on weather conditions.
Responsive Design – Optimized for mobile and desktop users.
Error Handling – Displays an error message for invalid city names or API failures.

Technologies Used:-
HTML: Structure of the app.
CSS: Styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Fetching API data, handling user input, and updating the UI dynamically.
Weather API: (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) for retrieving weather information.

How It Works:-
User enters a city name in the search bar.
The app sends an API request to fetch weather data.
The retrieved data is displayed dynamically on the screen.
Background or icons update based on the weather conditions.
